        <h2>On the Equality <span class="nowrap">of Ideas</span></h2>

        <h5>29 NOV 2012</h5>

        <p>
          My title was nearly the end of me. I was blind to the reality that I had long been struggling to do creative work within the restrictive confines of corporate culture. As a young designer, it’s easy to be duped into believing in the veneer of colorful walls, casual dress and all the things that make a workplace feel as it is designed to, creative. As such, you’re mindless of the daily reality that the first thing you check at the door upon entering is the identity with which you first arrived, that of a designer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have worked in a handful of industries for which the title, designer, must have accidentally been first applied via an unfortunate typo where ‘proletariat’ was instead intended. To be a designer in these places is to occupy the lowest possible station. Some companies go one further and offer also the even less fortunate designation, junior designer. The oxford english dictionary defines junior — as it relates to employment — as ‘low or lower in rank or status,’ a term applied throughout a hierarchy via assumption to anyone who reports to another for validation through approval. We can extrapolate this idea to creative work where those of a lesser status are implied, by title, to be less creative; further, their ideas less valuable.
        </p>

        <p>
          The above notions are baseless, driven by an epidemic hubris that pervades countless workplace cultures. But they are notions that we accept young in life and thus, learn to passively lament rather than actively and appropriately question.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some time ago, I found myself lost in a pursuit of words and abbreviations rather than ideas, knowledge and inspiration.

          With each new level of stratification came an additional measure of status, respect and authority to assume — and subsequently assert — the value of my ideas over those subordinate to me. My juniors.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wasn’t in the business of achieving as large a measure of authority as I was able simply for the sake of. Rather, I had been suffocating in an asphyxiating miasma of hierarchy for so long, I was desperate for the seniority required to put some of my ideas out into the world. With time, however, I began to realize an unfortunate side effect of the previously detailed system. With each new level of stratification achieved, I was granted an additional measure of paranoia that someone subordinate to me might have ideas that would come to be recognized as superior to my own.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now working to achieve only the permission granted via authority to express ideas, and driven to achieve by the fear that others might be more capable in their similar efforts, it was clear that I had lost my way. I strove not to simply realize my ideas through creation, but instead to be validated for my creations. In this, I welcomed my subordinate fate through acceptance, devaluing my every idea in the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          To be a designer is to know that our ideas are of equal value to one another’s, and to evaluate ideas based solely upon how appropriately they serve as a component in crafting creative solutions and telling compelling stories. No sooner did I realize this than I reclaimed the identity I will never again misplace and with it, the creative confidence I will never again be without.
